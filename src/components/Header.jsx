import React from "react";

const Header = () => {
  // JSX markup for the header section, displaying the title "Saveurs Orientales Dashboard"
  return <h2>Saveurs Orientales Dashboard</h2>;
};

export default Header;

// Explanation:

// The Header component is a functional component that represents the header section of the "Saveurs Orientales Dashboard."

// In the JSX markup, the component returns an <h2> element containing the text "Saveurs Orientales Dashboard." This heading element will be rendered as the header of the dashboard.

// Since this is a simple component with no dynamic data or state management, it doesn't require any state or props. It can be used as a static part of the user interface that remains the same throughout the application's lifecycle.
